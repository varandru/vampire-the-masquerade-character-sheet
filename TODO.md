# TODO

This is a global dump of ideas, wishes and other things. If a thing is here, I thought about getting to it. 


 - [ ] Basic design
   - [x] UI, in a more or less finalized state
   - [x] Move attributes and skills into the same place
   - [x] Attributes and skills should display a pop-up with expanded information
   - [ ] There are alternatives to Humanity. Make them pickable.
   - [x] Disciplines, rituals and attributes should display their name, not placeholder on top of expanded information
     - [x] Disciplines
     - [ ] Rituals
     - [x] Attributes
     - [x] Abilities
     - [x] Merits and Flaws
   - [ ] A theme should exist
     - [ ] Color theme
     - [ ] Android icon and app name
   - [ ] A level-up chart should be found in the app. At least a basic one, preferably an interactive one.
 - [ ] Make fiels editable
   - [x] Basic character information
   - [x] Attributes (and skills)
   - [ ] Disciplines (and their levels)
   - [ ] Demon disciplines and their weirdness
   - [ ] Maximum bloodpool (from generation)
   - [ ] Maximum willpower and humanity
   - [x] Merits and Flaws
   - [ ] Inventory?
 - [ ] Logic
   - [x] *All* serialized information must load on startup
   - [ ] Bloodpool maximum must depend on vampire's generation
   - [ ] Some stats depend on vampire's generation as well
   - [x] Clicking on a field square button should zero it. Makes, say, a blood pool of 0 possible
 - [ ] Serialization
   - [x] Main character information: name, sire, etc.
   - [x] Attributes and their descriptions/specialization
   - [x] Humanity and willpower levels
   - [x] Abilities
   - [x] Virtues
   - [x] Disciplines, sublevels of disciplines
   - [ ] Random-ass tables in Disciplines
   - [ ] Maybe move descriptions to Markdown, https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_markdown
   - [ ] Rituals
   - [x] Merits & Flaws
   - [ ] Alternatives to Humanity: Paths, Instincts, etc. 
   - [ ] Alternatives to Virtues: Instints and Conviction
 - [ ] Localization
